## About Me

Hi! My name is Zhichen Lai (pronounced Jhih-chen Lai). I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate of the Department of Computer Science at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/) (AAU), Denmark, supervised by [Prof. Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/), [Assoc. Prof. Dalin Zhang](https://dalinzhang.github.io/), and [Prof. Huan Li](https://longaspire.github.io/) (Zhejiang University, China). I am also a member of the Data Engineering, Science and Systems ([DESS](https://www.cs.aau.dk/research/Data-Engineering-Science-and-Systems)) group. From June to August 2024, I will be a Junior Visiting Research Fellow at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [the University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) (UNSW), Australia.

I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science from the Data Intelligence and Computing Art Lab at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) (SCU), China, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiancheng Lv](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1288/13627.htm) in 2021. Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC) in 2018.


My primary research areas are Data Management and Analytics. Specifically, my current research interests are as follows:
- **Lightweight AI for Sensory Data Analytics**
- **Spatio-temporal Data Applications**
- **Smart Meter Data Analytics**


My hobbies are travelling, singing, and making crafts.
