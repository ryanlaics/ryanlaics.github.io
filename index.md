## About Me

I am a Ph.D Candidate with the Department of Computer Science, [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/) (AAU), Denmark, under the supervision of [Prof. Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/), [Assoc. Prof. Dalin Zhang](https://dalinzhang.github.io/), and [Prof. Huan Li](https://longaspire.github.io/). I also work closely with [Prof. Hua Lu](https://luhua.ruc.dk/). I am a member of Data Engineering, Science and Systems ([DESS](https://www.cs.aau.dk/research/Data-Engineering-Science-and-Systems)) group. I recieved my master degree from the Data Intelligence and Computing Art Lab, [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) (SCU), China, in 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Jiancheng Lv, and my bachelor degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), both major in Computer Science. 

My primary research areas are Data Management and Analytics. Specifically, my current research interests are as follows:
- **Lightweight Deep Learning for Sensory Data Analytics**
- **Smart Meter Data Analytics**
- **Spatio-temporal Data Quality**

My hobbies are travelling, singing, and making crafts.
