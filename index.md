## About Me

My name is Zhichen Lai. I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate of the Department of Computer Science at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/) (AAU), Denmark, supervised by ACM/IEEE Fellow [Prof. Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/), [Prof. Dalin Zhang](https://dalinzhang.github.io/), and [Prof. Huan Li](https://longaspire.github.io/).


I was a Junior Visiting Research Fellow at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [the University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) (UNSW), Australia in 2024. I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) (SCU), China, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiancheng Lv](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1288/13627.htm) in 2021. Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC) in 2018.

My research interests include:
- **Sensory Data Analytics**
- **Spatio-temporal Data Management**
- **AI in Orthodontics**
- **Image Generation**
